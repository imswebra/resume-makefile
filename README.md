# Resume Makefile
Write your resume and references page in markdown and convert to pdf using a Makefile.

## Dependencies
- make
- pandoc
- wkhtmltopdf

## Instructions to make a pdf
1. Edit the markdown files in the "md" directory
2. In the main directory, run "make"
3. PDF versions of everything should have been generated in the "pdf" directory

## How it works
- pandoc is used to convert markdown (with a little bit of yaml) to html
- html is styled with css
- wkhtmltopdf is used to convert html/css files to pdf

## Directory structure
- "md/resumes"
    - contains markdown formatted content to go in resume
    - content will be inserted into the resume template
- "md/references"
    - similar to above but content will be inserted into references template
- "templates"
    - contains html templates which markdown content will be inserted into
- "css"
    - contains css to style templates
- "html"
    - contains html files generated by pandoc
- "pdf"
    - contains finished pdf files

## Pandoc templating system
- the beginning of the markdown files contain yaml blocks which are read by pandoc's templating system
- these yaml variables are passed to the html templates
- for more information, see the Pandoc documentation

## More info
- the css can be edited to your liking
- see the Makefile for more information on the build process and to set things like margins and paper size
